# emotion-classification-svm
This project aims to test a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier on multi-class emotion classification, using the EmoV-DB dataset. Various features are extracted from the audio data for training the classifier, including frequency-time domain and prosodic features.
The resulting performance was evaluated using several different metrics (weighted averages of precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy). Confusion matrices and t-SNE graphs were used as well to visually assess the model's performance across different variations of the baseline dataset.
